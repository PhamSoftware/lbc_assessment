Design and implement a small service which provides an HTTP API which would support a simple trading game.  In this game, players buy and sell items from each other, hunting through listings to find good deals and trying to entice other players to buy from them.  Your API must support the following three tasks:  1. Offer an item for sale 2. Buy an item that another player has offered 3. View all of the offers available from [n] randomly selected players  In addition, please provide basic test code which illustrates this API's functionality. Assume login and authentication are already provided by another service.  You are free to use any combination of languages, packages, and tools to serve and test the API.   We are especially interested in how you approach data modelling so we request that you persist and retrieve data using SQL statements for the SQLite database engine (which is available in most languages).  Include the API and test code in this box.   You may update your answer as many times as you like. We encourage you to post partial solutions.
